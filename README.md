# naRobot
A Robot ArT Project by [Nikolaj Andersson](https://github.com/NikolajAndersson) and [Alf Andersen](https://github.com/alfandersen)
6th Semester bachelor project @ [Art & Technology](http://art.aau.dk), Aalborg University, Denmark

The naRobot go program is a modified version of [joychair](https://github.com/fasmide/joychair) by [Kristian Mide](https://github.com/fasmide). Please check out his source code for more details.
The go-program runs on a Raspberry Pi, recieving data from a processing sketch over network UPD. The Raspberry passes the values on to an Arduino Leonardo, which passes it on to an electric wheelchair.
