This code is a modified version of github.com/fasmide/joychair by Kristian Mide. Please check out his source code for more details.
The go-program runs on a Raspberry Pi, recieving data from a processing sketch over network UPD. The Raspberry passes the values on to an Arduino Leonardo, which passes it on to an electric wheelchair.
